# EXPENSE_TRACKER-using-SQL
This project is a simple SQL-based Expense Tracker that I built to practice and strengthen my SQL fundamentals. The database contains users and their expenses, and I used SQL queries to analyze spending patterns and extract useful insights from the data.

In this project, I wrote queries to calculate total spending per user, category-wise expenses, monthly expenses per user, and to identify the highest spender and top 3 spenders. I also worked on queries to find expenses that are higher than the average expense, users whose total spending crosses a certain limit, and users who have not recorded any expenses.

Additionally, I practiced date-based analysis such as finding expenses between two dates and identifying the day with the highest total expense. Through this project, I improved my understanding of JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, subqueries, aggregate functions, and basic date handling in SQL.

This project helped me understand how real-world expense data can be queried and analyzed using SQL in a structured way.
